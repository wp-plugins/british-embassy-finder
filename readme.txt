Locate a Britsh Embassy, High Commission, or Consul anywhere in the world. Customisable.

== Description ==

Designed for sites offering advice or assistance to British Nationals abroad. It uses official UK Foreign Office data to provide you and your visitors with address, contact details, visiting hours etc plus a map for any British Foreign Mission worldwide.
It provides more information than the embassy finder tool on the UK Foreign Office web-site i.e. it includes a map to find the embassy/consul and sometimes an email address.

Designed to blend in with your site, with options for changing alignment, width, colors (text, button etc) and button label text.

You can try it out on this [Wordpress Travel Blog](http://blog.travelchimps.com).

The widget has been tested under Wordpress 3.3.1 / PHP 5 but should be compatible with WP 2.8 onwards.
- for more info and to check for known issues see my [Embassy Travel Widget page](http://travelchimps.com/widgets/uk-embassy-widget.php).

Your comments (via the above blog) would be appreciated.

== Installation ==

Requirement: 2.8 up (tested on 3.3.2 and PHP 5 against numerous themes)

The easyest way is direct from your WP Dashboard like any other widget:

1.Plugins -> Add New -> do a search for travel to find it -> click "install now"

2.Activate the plugin.

3.From the Dashboard 'Appearance' -> 'Widgets' menu. Drag the widget to the "widget area" you want it to appear in.

4. Whilst in this "widget area" you will see a faint dropdown arrow next any widgets that you have installed - this lets you customise them. 
   The travel widget uses your default color scheme, but if you wish you can customise colors, width and button text, and optionally display a link for an external page with other useful Travel Tools.
	 Screenshots of an example customised widget, and how to set it can be seen here:[travelchimps.com/widgets/uk-embassy-widget.php](http://travelchimps.com/widgets/uk-embassy-widget.php)

Alternatively:

1. Download the plugin direct from the Plugin Page at WordPress.org

2. Upload the WHOLE ZIP file (contains 'wp-ukembassy.php', 3 screenshot jpegs, and readme.txt) to your WordPress plugins directory ( normally /wp-content/plugins/ ).

3. Activate and configure as in 2 to 4 above.
